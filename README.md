# Body Segmentation in Chest X-Ray Images

This repository focuses on body segmentation in chest X-ray images using image processing techniques. The project aims to isolate and extract the body part from X-ray images, providing a clear representation against a transparent background. Key tasks include:

## Image Preprocessing
- Loading and enhancing the X-ray images for better visibility.
- Applying filters to reduce noise and improve segmentation accuracy.

## Body Segmentation
- Utilizing techniques such as thresholding, edge detection, or contour finding to identify and isolate the body part.
- Implementing advanced segmentation algorithms like watershed or region-growing methods, if necessary.

## Output Generation
- Extracting the segmented body part and saving it as an image with a transparent background for easy integration into further analysis or visualization.

This project serves as a practical exploration of image processing techniques in medical imaging, enhancing the understanding of how to manipulate and analyze medical data effectively.
